AFE: Awesome Fucking Editor

This was an attempt at making an editor from scratch, and it was never
finished. Most of the backend stuff is done (holding, modifying text)
etc, but there isn't any gui.

Directories:
    lib:
        test files and documents relating to the project
    bin:
        makefile puts the binary here
    obj:
        where the intermediate files go (.o)
    src:
        source code
    inc:
        header files
    test:
        where test directories and testmgr script are
        testmgr is broken right now.
