The historians call this activity of the histor-
ical figures "the reaction." 

In dealing with this period they sternly con- 
demn the historical personages who, in their 
opinion, caused what they describe as the re- 
action. All the well-known people of that pe- 
riod, from Alexander and Napoleon to Ma- 
dame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Cha- 
teaubriand, and the rest, pass before their 
stern judgment seat and are acquitted or con- 
demned according to whether they conduced 
to progress or to reaction. 

According to their accounts a reaction took 
place at that time in Russia also, and the chief 
culprit was Alexander I, the same man who ac- 
cording to them was the chief cause of the lib- 
eral movement at the commencement of his 
reign, being the savior of Russia.
