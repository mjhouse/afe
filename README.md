# AFE

This is the back end for a text editor that would have included some features that I haven't seen natively included in other C++/GTK text editors

Directories:
    lib:
        test files and documents relating to the project
    bin:
        makefile puts the binary here
    obj:
        where the intermediate files go (.o)
    src:
        source code
    inc:
        header files
    test:
        where test directories and testmgr script are
        testmgr is broken right now.
