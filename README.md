# AFE

This is the back end for a text editor that would have included some features that I haven't seen natively included in other C++/GTK text editors. Specifically, multi-cursor editing was the main feature that I wanted to focus on. The front end was never completed, but the text buffer and associated data structures were.

### Directories:
* lib: test files and documents relating to the project
* bin: makefile puts the binary here
* obj: where the intermediate files go (.o)
* src: source code
* inc: header files
* test: where test directories and testmgr script is.
